This is a final project of Java Technoatom/Technosphere course provided by Mail.ru Group, which can be found at:

Git - https://github.com/rybalkinsd/atom

Goal of this project is to develop backend server for multiplayer browser game, which is called BomberMan.

Stack, which was used, is JavaSE/SpringBoot/JavaScript/Gradle.

Some frontend was provided by course, sourses can be found at https://github.com/rybalkinsd/atom-bomberman-frontend

I made couple of fixes in frontend to satisfy my needs, but it still very dirty, because I'm not javascript developer.

Backend is fully developed by myself.

Project hosted at AWS http://18.197.237.155:8080/frontend/ , feel free to check it out in work.

*Note*: Game implemented for 4 players, so if you want to check it solo, you'll have to open 4 browser tabs.
